## Be the very best

Your content doesn't need to be the best so that people can appreciate it. It just needs to be easy to find and relatable to your audience. 

Be an amateur at many things instead of being a master at only one. Diversify your learning. Our world is changing at such speeds that if you try to master one thing and when you're done it might be irrelevant.

Publish the work that you think is the best but don't brag about it. The more good work you put out the more people you will attract, some will like your work some won't and some will genuinely give guidance about improving your work. 

Life is full of ups and downs. You will have to learn to live with them if you want do fulfill your dreams. Quitting pre-maturely or just because you aren't doing well isn't a great excuse to throw away whatever you've accomplished in your life.


Like a chain-smoker lights a cigarette before the current one finishes you should also start thinking about your next project before your current one finishes A creative person's best quality should be that he should be able to take a punch, Meaning that he should be able to handle all types of criticism positively.

## Learn in public

Start learning a new skill and tell every single person that you can, write blog posts about what you learned today, find an online forum and chat with people learning the same thing.

Connect with people that are better than you in your field and learn from them while trying to contribute to the work they are doing. In the time where everything is connected via the internet you or any other person can contribute to anything they want.
